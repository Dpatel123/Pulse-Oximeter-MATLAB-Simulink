# Pulse-Oximeter-MATLAB-Simulink
Pulse oximeter project MATLAB simulink model to verify the Filter Design


Step-1: Open and run the poxi_raws.m script in MATLAB.
Step-2: Open polagacy.slx in MATLAB simulink.
Step-3: Run the simulink model and check the scope outputs.

**Note:** Refre lagacy code blocks from the same project functions i.e. ex_sfun_spctrl_hp.
